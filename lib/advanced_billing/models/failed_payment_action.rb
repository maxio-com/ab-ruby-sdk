module AdvancedBilling
  # Action taken when payment for an invoice fails: - `leave_open_invoice` -
  # prepayments and credits applied to invoice; invoice status set to "open";
  # email sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies);
  # payment failure recorded in the invoice history. This is the default option.
  # - `rollback_to_pending` - prepayments and credits not applied; invoice
  # remains in "pending" status; no email sent to the customer; payment failure
  # recorded in the invoice history. - `initiate_dunning` - prepayments and
  # credits applied to the invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent to
  # the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure
  # recorded in the invoice history; subscription will  most likely go into
  # "past_due" or "canceled" state (depending upon net terms and dunning
  # settings).
